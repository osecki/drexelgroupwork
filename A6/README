Running the code:

-To run the code, run make flex and parse. To compile it, type 'make compile'.
To run it, use ./Compiler < input. There are some included files in samples/* 
which tests our code for all cases, including the ones specifically asked to 
test in "What to do". TODO

How the code works:
-The code works through changes in Bison, Funcall, and new classes. In
Bison, it now allows regular class statements with or without parameres and
with or without inheritance and allows for dot notaiton funcalls. In
Funcall, if it is from inside a class, it is handled specially. New classes
were made to handle class statement objects, class objects, and class
function calls, respectively. TODO

Testing:
-Testing was done using the files in samples/*. They all test a bunch of
class and inheritnace examples, and there is the officialInput file for everything
asked for in the "What to do" section, along with officialInput_out for its
output. They can all easily be tested by running "./runAll Compiler". 
The test file will be printed out, followed by the resulting
environment. Simply hit enter to go from file to file in samples/.
-The official 'sample input' and 'sample output' provided is in
officialInput and officialInput_out, respectively. TODO
