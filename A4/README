Running the code:

-To run the code, run make flex, parse, and compile to build it. Then run
either "./Compiler < inputFile" or "make run < inputFile". There are some
included file sample_in_* which exercises everything using the new memory
management and also garbage collection.

How the code works:
-

Testing:
-Testing was done using sample_input. The file contains a series of test to
exercise ... A sample output is included which shows the results of
this. As far as we know, there is nothing wrong with our code.
